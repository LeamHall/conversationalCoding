Pacakge Foundation focuses on the foundational tasks of the language,
the building blocks. This is the one you should start with, and stick with,
until you can do it fluently.

0.		Open your heart and mind to learning. Don't beat yourself up if
		you don't do everything perfectly the first time out.
		I didn't, and I'm writing the thing...

1.		Comment out each single line.
1.1.	Add a descriptive comment for each item.

2.		Declare the package main.

3.		Import something that allows printing, and something for errors.

4.		Define a function that takes an int and returns it doubled.
4.1.	Return an error if the int is 5.

5.		Define a function that takes a string, and returns "Hello " and the string.

6.		Define a struct that has a string.

7.		Define a method that returns the string from #6.

8.		Define a string outside of the main function.

9.		Start the main function.

10.		Define a variable that uses the string from #5.
10.1.	Print the variable.

11.		Define a variable of the struct from #6.
11.1.	Assign a string to the string attribute
11.2.	Call the method and print the string.

12.		Make an slice of odd numbers.
12.1.	Write a for loop that iterates over the slice and prints the number doubled.

13.		Using three people you know, make a map with their name as the key, and 
		describe the relationship as the value.
13.1.	Using range, iterate over the map and print each key and value.

14.		Write a for loop that counts from 5 to 18.
14.1.	Have it print something funny at 7 and 17.

15.		Using the function from #5, pass in a non-string. Handle the error.

16.		Delete this file, and do it again tomorrow.  :)
