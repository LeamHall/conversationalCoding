# Pointers

Create a file called pointers and append whatever suffix you need

Create a function that takes a pointer to an int, and returns the int doubled.

Create an int variable, and pass it to the doubler function.

Add an int and an * int.

Increment the original int variable via a pointer to it.

Think about what challenged you, make some notes, and then delete the file.
