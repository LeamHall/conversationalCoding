# Pointers

Create a file called pointers.go.

## Package level constructs

## Main

Create an int variable, and pass it to the doubler function.

Add an int and a *int.

Increment the original int variable via a pointer to it.


## Wrap up

Think about what challenged you, make some notes, and then delete the file.
