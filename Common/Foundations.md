# Foundations

The Foundation section focuses on the foundational tasks of the language;
the building blocks. This is the one you should start with, and stick with,
until you can do it fluently. When you're up to 80%, move on to the next
task, but keep doing this one every couple of days until you have it right.

Open your heart and mind to learning. Don't beat yourself up if you don't do 
everything perfectly the first time out. I didn't, and I'm writing the thing...

## Code structure

Create a file named foundations and append whatever suffix you need

As you code, write a descriptive comment for each item.

If you language requires it, import something for printing to STDOUT, and error handling.

## High level constructs

### Variables, Functions, and Errors

Define a global structure (struct, class) that has a string.
Define a method that returns the string from the structure.
Assign something to the string attribute of the structure.
Use the method to print the string.

Define a string outside of the main scope.
Define a variable that uses the global scope string.
Define a function that takes a string, and returns "Hello " and the string.
Use the function and print the "Hello" string.

Define a function that takes an int and returns it doubled.
Return an error if the int is 5.
Using the function that doubles ints, pass in 5 and handle the error.


### Blocks and iteration
Write a loop that counts from 5 to 18.
  Have it print something funny at 7 and 17.

Make an slice/array/list of a few numbers.
  Write a loop that iterates over the slice and prints the number doubled.

Using three people you know, make a key-value store (kvs) with their name 
  as the key, and describe the relationship as the value.
  Iterate over the kvs and print each key and value.

### Wrap up

Make a copy of the file as is, and then run a linter or formatter on the copy.
See what changed.

Delete the files. If you missed more than one thing, do it again tomorrow.  :)
